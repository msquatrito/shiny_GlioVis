**CIMP status**    
CIMP status has been determined  by **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, using TCGA GBM as training dataset.    

**Subtypes**   
*- GBM*   
For the GBM subtype classification we use the 3 TCGA expression subtypes (Classical, Mesenchymal,Proneural) as defined in [Wang Q. et al. 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/13/052076).   
   
*- LGG*  
For the LGG subtype classification we use the 3 TCGA molecular subtypes (IDH mutant with 1p/19q codeletion, IDH mutant without 1p/19q codeletion, IDH wild-type) as defined in [NEJM, 2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061751). **Important note:** the GlioVis LGG classification identifies "molecular subtypes" using expression data. Such approach has to be considered very preliminary untill further validation.        
   
Classification algorithms:      
* The Subtype calls generated by **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, are done performing a linear Kernel with 10-fold cross validation, using the `ksvm` function of the [‘kernlab’](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kernlab/kernlab.pdf) package. As training dataset for the GBM we use the TCGA GBM samples described in [Wang Q. et al. 2016](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/08/052076). As training dataset for the LGG we use the TCGA LGG samples described in [NEJM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061751).         
* The **K-nearest neighbor (K-NN)** Subtype calls, are obtained using the `knn3Train` function of the [‘caret’](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/caret.pdf) package, using the subtypes as in the SVM calls.  
* The Subtype call generated  by **single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA)**, is done using the `runSsGSEAwithPermutation` function of the [‘ssgsea.GBM.classification’](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/08/052076) package. Not available yet for LGG samples.
